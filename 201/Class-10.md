## The JavaScript Debugger.

### How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

"In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code. At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values. After examining values, you can resume the execution of code (typically with a play button)."

### Define what a breakpoint is.
Its an intentional stopping or pausing place in a program, and put in a place for debugging purposes.

### What is the call stack?

Stores information about the active subrountines of a computer program.
