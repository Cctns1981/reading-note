## Learn HTML

### When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?
Improve the readability of your HTML code, it also applies meaning to content which would otherwise have none. 

### How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?
The <ul> HTML element represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list.

### When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?
Unordered lists are used when the order of the items is not relevant. List items in unordered lists are marked with a bullet. Ordered lists are used for sequential information and are automatically enumerated by the browser.

### Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?
type="1"	The list items will be numbered with numbers (default)
type="A"	The list items will be numbered with uppercase letters
type="a"	The list items will be numbered with lowercase letters
type="I"	The list items will be numbered with uppercase roman numbers
type="i"	The list items will be numbered with lowercase roman numbers

### Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?
The border is drawn between the margin and the padding of a box. If you are using the standard box model, the size of the border is added to the width and height of the content box.

### Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?

Content box: The area where your content is displayed; size it using properties like inline-size and block-size or width and height.
Padding box: The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties.
Border box: The border box wraps the content and any padding; size it using border and related properties.
Margin box: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; size it using margin and related properties.

## Learn JS

### What data types can you store inside of an Array?

Arrays are generally described as "list-like objects"; they are basically single objects that contain multiple values stored in a list

Arrays are classified as Homogeneous Data Structures because they store elements of the same type. They can store numbers, strings, boolean values (true and false), characters, objects, and so on.

### Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?

JavaScript variables can be objects. Arrays are special kinds of objects.

Because of this, you can have variables of different types in the same Array.

You can have objects in an Array. You can have functions in an Array. You can have arrays in an Array:

### List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do

Arithmetic Operators-mathematical function that takes two operands and performs a calculation on them.

Comparison Operators- is a binary operator that takes two operands whose values are being compared. Comparison operators are used in conditional statements, especially in loops, where the result of the comparison decides whether execution should proceed.

Logical (or Relational) Operators- Relational operators compare values and return either TRUE or FALSE. Logical operators perform logical operations on TRUE and FALSE.

Assignment Operators- An assignment operator, in the context of the C programming language, is a basic component denoted as “=”.

Conditional (or ternary) Operators-The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark ( ? ), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon ( : ), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy

### Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.

(10 > 5) is the condition to test, which in this case is true — 10 is greater than 5. The part contained inside curly braces {} is the block of code to run. Because the condition passes, the variable outcome is assigned the value "if block".


### Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.
Loops are all about doing the same thing over and over again. Often, the code will be slightly different each time round the loop, or the same code will run but with different variables
